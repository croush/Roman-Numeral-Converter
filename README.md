This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Roman Numeral Conversion

This is a play project to explore ReactJS further, and to complete the TDD Code Kata. An effort was made to test react components as well as functions with Jest and Enzyme; more work is needed to complete this. Functions (toRoman and toDecimal) were written and tested with Mocha and Chai. The tests were finally moved and added to the repo in the third commit.

Testing was important in the development of this simple app. It was most useful to develop and test the functionality before trying to implement a React component.

ToDo:
* There is a potential hang-up problem when the user input is very long. Chrome asks to kill the app when this happens. 
* Aesthetics
